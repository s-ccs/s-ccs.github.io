Unfortunately, we failed to replicate these effects – on the one hand, we had to stop acquisition early due to COVID-19, on the other hand, we found anecdotal evidence in favour of the H0.</p> <p>Karolis made use of laminar fMRI, and accordingly in this thesis art, I used a layerified horizontal slice of brain &#40;bigBrain&#41;. The layers are completely made up by the words of his thesis – overall ~55.000 characters were used. This was the first time that I completed a thesis art in Julia. It was a blast&#33; Not only could I completely extract all PDF text easily, but I also used a nice library to solve a large travelling salesman problem. Finally, using makie.jl, plotting that many characters took only 0.5s – and it did not crash at all &#40;compared to my experience with matlab/ggplot&#41;.

We concurrently measured Pupil Labs Glasses and an Eyelink 1000. In the thesis art I selected six of the tasks and visualized the data of one subject using the letters of her thesis.

To do this, we “tagged” the to-be-tracked objects and distractor with different frequencies, so that we can trace them in the EEG. What you see here is the SSVEP response over time for three trials per row. At the beginning and end, the response is small because the object was not tracked, only in the middle part one can see that the response is much larger, the object was tracked. The plot is “written” by the first 10.000 letters of Lisa’s Thesis.</p> <p>The idea of “thesis art” is to inspire discussion with persons who do not have an academic background or work in a different field.

I recorded my eye-movements while reading her thesis about eye movements&#40;using these cool 3D-printable open source eye trackers&#33;&#41; . Every red dot is a fixation &#40;a moment where the eye stayed still&#41; and every line connects two fixations with an eye movement. It is clear that I focused on the words, but some figures elicit specific eye tracking behaviour. Of course it is up to the viewer to figure out, which page contains what content.</p> <p><img src="/assets/lilli_r_bearbeitet_small-724x1024.jpg" alt="" /></p> <p>The idea is to inspire discussion with persons who do not have an academic background or work in a different field.
