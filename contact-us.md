# Get in touch

You can contact us here: [daniela.milanese@vis.uni-stuttgart.de](mailto:daniela.milanese@vis.uni-stuttgart.de) or [benedikt.ehinger@vis.uni-stuttgart.de](mailto:benedikt.ehinger@vis.uni-stuttgart.de). 

We will try to answer within 3 business  days. 

Sometimes it can happen that your email receives lower priority than it should - if after 7 days, for urgent matters sooner, you haven't received an answer back, please resend the email. If it is really urgent, please find a second channel to contact us.

**For students:** I lived in Norway, where you'd just greet everyone by first name. This is not the case in Germany, therefore use this pragmatic solution: In your first email write `Dear Benedikt Ehinger` or `Dear Prof. Ehinger`. If one of us ends our e-mail with `Firstname`, this signals that this person would be fine with "Du" aka `Firstname` in further emails.

We rarely explicitly learn how to email, [this is a good guide how to email by Edwin Dalmaijer](https://www.dalmaijer.org/2022/03/how-to-email-your-lecturer-professor/)

# How to Find Us

Our offices can be found at Universit√§tsstr. 32, 70569 Stuttgart. Because it's not the easiert building to find on campus, we created a small video on [how to get to our offices](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/WnlbgIiV7FY?feature=share).

We also have a lab, where our experiments are run, you can find a similar guide here on [how to get to our lab](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/3AhGc_V7y3Y)
