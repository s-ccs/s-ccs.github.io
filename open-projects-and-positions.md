# Open Positions
If you think about working with us and want to apply, I highly recommend reading through [this link](http://www.thememolab.org/pages/gradapps/) prior to writing your statement. It is from the MemoLab (US-based), but many things apply as well. At some point I hope to write my own document, but this has to suffice for now.

### PostDoc/PhD
We are hiring a 100% TVL-13 position via the [Max Planck Graduate School IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/) - Deadline is 16th November.

### HiWi
Currently no open HiWi positions - maybe in Summer 2025 again.

# Open Projects
If you are interested in the areas of methods development, EEG, Eye-Tracking, Visual Processing, Cognitive Science, it is always a good idea to shoot us an email. Sometimes we have capacities for theses without a formal offer. Note on external theses: We usually only accept these if they fit within the topic of our lab.

### BSc / MSc
The following topics are currently open:
- Assessing the pattern detection model for ERPgnostics.jl
- Insights from a very large EEG+Eyetracking dataset
- A GPU implementation of AMICA.jl
- The statistical properties of MixedModels-Clusterpermutation-Tests
- Webcam-Eyetracking and spatial biases in 2-AFC tasks
