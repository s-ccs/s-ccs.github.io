### Modelling human activity
The goal of the Stuttgart Computational Cognitive Science group, is to **understand human behavior** and **brain activity** under realistic conditions. We focus on **advancing methodological approaches** in combined EEG (a method to measure brain potentials), Eye-Tracking and Cognitive Modelling. We provide **open source** tools (e.g. [Unfold](https://www.unfoldtoolbox.org), [Unfold.jl](https://github.com/unfoldtoolbox/Unfold.jl), [eegvis](https://github.com/behinger/eegvis) and others).
